    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      We are Tyler Kerns and Sam Frost. While sharing a dorm room almost a decade ago, we discovered a brilliant series of linguistics puzzles. They became our fixation that summer, alongside our other hobbies such as pizza and Xbox. Since then we've picked up more productive pastimes like programming and web design, allowing us to revisit these old puzzles with a new perspective.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this site is to serve as a homage to those linguistics puzzles that entertained us all those years ago, most of which have not been regularly maintained. The puzzles were created by organizations such as the<a href="https://www.nacloweb.org/" class="main-links" target="_blank">NACLO</a>, its predecessor<a href="https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/LCbackground.htm" class="main-links" target="_blank">The Linguistics Challenge</a>, and a handful of others, and credit is given where it is due. All we've done is given them a new home with functional answer-checking and a more accessible design.

      This site was created collaboratively using HTML and pure CSS, with the puzzles and other interactive bits powered by JavaScript. Tyler has <a href="https://www.tylerkerns.com" target="_blank" class="main-links">a website</a> which directs students to excellent programming resources and also documents his own learning experience. Sam can be reached via <a href="https://www.sam-frost.com" target="_blank" class="main-links">his site</a>, which has nothing to do with either programming or linguistics.
