    <h2>Why does this site exist</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This page serves as a collection of language puzzles, resources, and a few memes. The main purpose
      of its creation was to rework some old language puzzles found online that had not bene updated or maintained.
      The puzzles were created by other organizations such as ***. Each is attributed with the appropriate organization
      and author.
      This page only serves to present the completed puzzles with functioning answer-checking, and maybe a more
      attractive
      design.
