    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      We are Tyler Kerns and Sam Frost. While sharing a dorm room almost a decade ago, we discovered a brilliant series of linguistics puzzles that became a weeks-long fixation. At the time, our other hobbies were limited to pizza and Xbox, but since then we've picked up more productive pastimes like programming and web design. These new skills have allowed us to revisit these old puzzles with a new perspective.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this site is to serve as an homage to those linguistics puzzles that entertained us all those years ago, most of which have not been regularly maintained. They were created by various organizations such as the<a href="https://www.nacloweb.org/" class="main-links" target="_blank">NACLO</a>, its predecessor<a href="https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/LCbackground.htm" class="main-links" target="_blank">The Linguistics Challenge</a>, and a handful of others, to whom we give credit and provide links at every opportunity. All we've done is given the puzzles a new home with functional answer-checking and a more accessible design. 
    </p>

      This site was created collaboratively using HTML and pure CSS, with the puzzles and other interactive bits powered by JavaScript. Tyler has <a href="https://www.tylerkerns.com" target="_blank" class="main-links">a website</a> which directs students to useful programming resources and also documents his own learning experience. Sam can be reached via <a href="https://www.sam-frost.com" target="_blank" class="main-links">his site</a>, which has nothing to do with either programming or linguistics.
