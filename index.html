    <h2>What is FrostyKernel?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a place to melt your brain in a linguistic fashion. </p>
    <p>We at FrostyKernel are passionate about three things: puzzles, languages, and web development. When we found out that there were dozens of linguistics puzzles based on diverse languages from all over the planet, the only logical next step was to build a website about it.</p>

    <h2>Wait, so... why exactly does this site exist?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The puzzles featured here were concocted by brilliant academics belonging to organizations such as the <a href="https://www.nacloweb.org/" class="main-links" target="_blank">NACLO</a> and its predecessor <a href="https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/LCbackground.htm" class="main-links" target="_blank">The Linguistics Challenge</a>. Some of the original puzzles have not been updated or maintained, however, and our mission is to preserve the mechanics of each puzzle while providing functional answer-checking and an accessible design. All the source material is linked and credited where appropriate, and we highly recommend taking a moment to visit the organizations whose work we draw upon.</p>

      <h3>The Linguistics Challenge</h3>
      <p>A predecessor to the<a href="https://www.nacloweb.org/" class="main-links">NACLO</a> whose challenges emphasize cultural awareness and language preservation. Now defunct, but the site is still maintained<a href="https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/LCbackground.htm" class="main-links" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>NACLO</h3>
      <p>The North American Computation Linguistics Open is a problem-solving contest for high-schoolers, but the puzzles are challenging and engaging regardless of age or background. You don't need prior knowledge about linguistics whatsoever to participate &mdash; just your critical thinking skills.</p>

      <h3>More Coming Soon</h3>
      <p>As more puzzles are added, information about their creators will appear here.</p>
