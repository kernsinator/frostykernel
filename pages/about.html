    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We are Tyler Kerns and Sam Frost. Almost a decade ago, while sharing a dorm room, we discovered some of these online language
       puzzles and added them to our list of hobbies. Other hobbies at the time included Xbox and pizza.
        Remembering the fun we had solving these puzzles, as well as the frustration of those that didn't work,
         we decided to recreate the puzzles here. </p>
    <h2>Why does this site exist</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This page serves as a collection of language puzzles, resources, and a few memes. The main purpose
      of its creation was to rework some old language puzzles found online that had not been updated or maintained.
      The puzzles were created by organizations such as the<a href="https://www.nacloweb.org/" class="main-links" target="_blank">NACLO</a> and
       its predecessor<a href="https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/LCbackground.htm" class="main-links" target="_blank">The Linguistics Challenge</a>, and others.
         Each is attributed with the appropriate organization
      and author.
      This page only serves to present the completed puzzles with functioning answer-checking, and maybe a more
      attractive
      design.
    </p>

    <p>
      The terrible structure and design of this site was created by Tyler using HTML, straight CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
       Sam contributed to the working puzzles, as well as many other useful parts of this 
       monstrosity. He can be reached through his personal<a href="#" class="main-links" target="_blank">site</a>. Tyler has a site documenting
       his own learning experience<a href="https://www.tylerkerns.com" target="_blank"
       class="main-links">here</a>.
