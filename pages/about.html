    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We are Tyler Kerns and Sam Frost. Almost a decade ago, while sharing a dorm room, we discovered some of these
      online language
      puzzles and added them to our list of hobbies. Other hobbies at the time included Xbox and pizza.
      Remembering the fun we had solving these puzzles, as well as the frustration of those that didn't work,
      we decided to recreate the puzzles here. </p>

    <p>
      This site was created using HTML, straight CSS, and a little bit of
      vanilla JavaScript. Tyler insisted on building without frameworks or plugins so that building this site would reinforce the fundamentals.
      Sam insisted on this site actually looking decent and functioning as well. Sam can be reached through his personal<a href="https://www.sam-frost.com" class="main-links" target="_blank">site</a>. Tyler
      has a site documenting
      his own learning experience<a href="https://www.tylerkerns.com" target="_blank" class="main-links">here</a>.
