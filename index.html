    <p>
      This is a place to melt your brain in a linguistic fashion.</p>
    <p>The difficulty ratings were provided
      by the organizations that created the puzzles. You can rest assured that there is something for everyone.

    <h2>Why does this site exist</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This page serves as a collection of language puzzles, resources, and a few memes. The main purpose
      of its creation was to rework some old language puzzles found online that had not been updated or maintained.
      The puzzles were created by organizations such as the<a href="https://www.nacloweb.org/" class="main-links"
        target="_blank">NACLO</a> and
      its predecessor<a href="https://lingclub.mycpanel.princeton.edu/challenge/LCbackground.htm" class="main-links"
        target="_blank">The Linguistics Challenge</a>, among others.
      Each is attributed with the appropriate organization
      and author.
      This site serves to present the completed puzzles with functioning answer-checking, and maybe a more
      attractive
      design.
