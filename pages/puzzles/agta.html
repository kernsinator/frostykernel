        Adapted by Tom Payne from Healey, Phyllis M. 1960. An Agta grammar. Manila: Bureau of printing.
        Bandera ng Pilipinas
        The following list of words is from the Agta language of the Central Cagayan Valley in the 
        Northern island of Luzon, in the Philippines. There are now only about 600 speakers of this variety of Agta, 
        although there are perhaps 10,000 people in the Philippines who speak other varieties also known as Agta. The 
        Agta people now speak an Austronesian language similar to other languages spoken in the Philippines. However, 
        they are descended from the Melanesian people who were present in the Philippines before the Austronesian peoples arrived.
         The Agta language is now seriously endangered
