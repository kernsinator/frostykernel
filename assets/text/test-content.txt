We are Tyler and Sam. About a decade ago we discovered some of these online language puzzles and added them to our list of hobbies. Other hobbies included Xbox and pizza. Remembering the fun we had solving these puzzles, as well as the frustration of the broken site, we decided to recreate the puzzles here.

  The following list of words is from the Agta language of the Central Cagayan Valley in the Northern island of Luzon, in the Philippines. There are now only about 600 speakers of this variety of Agta, although there are perhaps 10,000 people in the Philippines who speak other varieties also known as Agta. The Agta people now speak an Austronesian language similar to other languages spoken in the Philippines. However, they are descended from the Melanesian people who were present in the Philippines before the Austronesian peoples arrived. The Agta language is now seriously endangered
